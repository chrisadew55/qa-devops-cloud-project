# qa-devops-cloud-project
A repository for the DfE Cloud Specialism final project

# Project overview
The brief for this project was to create a web application using the Flask micro-framework that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality. I was required to use the Flask micro-framework to build my app (front and backend) in Python, utilising the information stored on a MySQL database with a minimum of two tables, and a one-to-many relationship. I was then expected to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically tests, builds and deploys my app with the help of Jenkins and Docker. This structure is represented below:
